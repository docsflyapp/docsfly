# MDX Features

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your Markdown files, giving you the power to create interactive documentation.

## Basic Markdown

All standard Markdown features are supported:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Inline code`
- [Links](https://example.com)

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## React Components

You can use React components directly in your MDX files:

```mdx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

<Button>Click me!</Button>
```

## Frontmatter
